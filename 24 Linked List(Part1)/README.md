# Apna_College_Java_DSA

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in the **Apna College Java DSA Course**. Here, I will be uploading all the resources, notes, code, and projects that I learn and build throughout the course. It will be an ongoing collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, Java programming, and practical problem-solving.

## ðŸš€ Course Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It is designed to improve problem-solving skills and coding proficiency, which is essential for competitive programming, interviews, and mastering coding in Java.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Searching, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, etc.

## ðŸ“š Learning Topics

- Java Basics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees
- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Advanced Data Structures: Heaps, Hashmaps
- Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Backtracking
- Problem-solving and coding challenges (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank)
